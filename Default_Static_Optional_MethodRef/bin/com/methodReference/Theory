1)It is used to write in a lambda code is already
present inside another method, then we can point to the
existing method using method reference.
2)It is used for code reusability
3)Uses existing logic/functionality
4)Must be same argument
5)Alternate to lambda expression
6)Four types of method reference :

  1)Static method reference (class :: static method)
  2)Constructor reference (class :: new)
  3)Reference to instance method from other class (class :: instanceMethod)
  4)Reference to instance method from instance (objRef :: instanceMethod)
